Summonses

This project's purpose is to explore the effectiveness of issuing summonses
on the number of collisions in New York City. Along the way, there are some
useful parsers for the data (strangely available only in weird formats on the
NYPD website as far as I can tell) and some useful (I hope) examples of tests.
